Issues and bugs list

## Game.Application Module

- Event logic hard to follow, events dependent on other events. Try to improve DX.

- World type may need a WorldRef type that decide the rules of the world.

- Application freeze on rare occasion when player run into an enemy (probably when
enemy and hero is changing to the same position the same time the map is drawn).
